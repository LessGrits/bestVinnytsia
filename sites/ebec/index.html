                    <p>In addition, within engineering competition, we provide the opportunity for students of technical
                        universities to develop and realize their ideas through collaboration with companies and
                        communication
                        with the European education community.</p>

                    <p>BEST, The Student Council of the Technical Universities of Europe is a growing, non-profit,
                        non-political
                        organization. Since 1989, BEST has provided communication, cultural connections and exchange
                        opportunities for students across Europe.</p>
                    <p>96 local groups in 34 countries create a growing, well-organized, powerful, young and innovative
                        student
                        network. More than 15,000 students are involved in the daily development of our organization,
                        and
                        nearly
                        one million students participate in our events.</p>

                    <p>BEST helps technology students from Europe become more internationally-minded, through a better
                        understanding of European culture and the ability to help and work in the world around them.
                        Through
                        BEST courses and Engineering competitions, students can broaden their knowledge in fields close
                        to
                        their
                        technical background.
                    </p>
                    <p>BEST, as an organization, creates a space in which students can exchange knowledge through the
                        organization of activities such as academic courses, engineering competitions, training
                        symposia,
                        trainings, cultural exchanges and, of course, leisure activities. On the other hand, BEST is
                        trying
                        to
                        expand the labor market horizon by organizing work-related activities (job fairs, company
                        visits,
                        seminars). Lastly, BEST has developed its own training system, so BEST members also have the
                        opportunity
                        to improve their skills and knowledge by practicing technical or personal training.
